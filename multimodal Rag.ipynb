documents contain a mixture of content types, including text, tables, and images.\n","\n","Semi-structured data can be challenging for conventional RAG for at least two reasons:\n","\n","* Text splitting may break up tables, corrupting the data in retrieval\n","* Embedding tables may pose challenges for semantic similarity search\n","\n","And the information captured in images is typically lost.\n","\n","With the emergence of multimodal LLMs, like [GPT4-V](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4v-system-card), it is worth considering how to utilize images in RAG:\n","\n","`Option 1:`\n","\n","* Use multimodal embeddings (such as [CLIP](https://openai.com/research/clip)) to embed images and text\n","* Retrieve both using similarity search\n","* Pass raw images and text chunks to a multimodal LLM for answer synthesis\n","\n","`Option 2:`\n","\n","* Use a multimodal LLM (such as [GPT4-V](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4v-system-card), [LLaVA](https://llava.hliu.cc/), or [FUYU-8b](https://www.adept.ai/blog/fuyu-8b)) to produce text summaries from images\n","* Embed and retrieve text\n","* Pass text chunks to an LLM for answer synthesis\n","\n","`Option 3:`\n","\n","*

images\n","* Embed and retrieve image summaries with a reference to the raw image\n","* Pass raw images and text chunks to a multimodal LLM for answer synthesis   \n","\n","This cookbook show how we might tackle this :\n","\n","* We will use [Unstructured](https://unstructured.io/) to parse images, text, and tables from documents (PDFs).\n","* We will use the [multi-vector retriever](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/multi_vector) to store raw tables, text, (optionally) images along with their summaries for retrieval.\n","* We will demonstrate `Option 2`, and will follow-up on the other approaches in future cookbooks.\n","\n","![ss_mm_rag.png](attachment:9bbbcfe4-2b85-4e76-996a-ce8d1497d34e.png)\n","\n","##
